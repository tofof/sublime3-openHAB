sublime3-openHAB
================

These files provide syntax highlighting for the openHAB configuration files in Sublime Text 3. The current status is far from complete but works pretty good for me. Although I am not an openHAB developer and have never created a syntax highlighting file before, yet this seems to be a good starting point. Feel free to send merge requests and help to improve and extend.

## Installation

I have not created a Sublime Text package yet, so you need to manually copy the files to a suitable location to make your Sublime Text installation recognize them (i.e. `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User`).

## What is supported

Currently the following components are supported in their respective configuration files
- Things
- Items
- Sitemaps
- Persistence
- Rules (very limited!)
